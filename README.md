# Task 2 – Zomato App Screen Redesign

## 📱 Objective
To redesign an existing app screen with improved usability, branding, and user experience.  
Chosen App: **Zomato**

## 🧠 UX Problems Identified
- The original login screen lacked emotional impact and felt flat.
- Generic CTA ("Continue") did not connect with the user.
- Weak visual branding for a food delivery app.
- No indication of what comes next in the journey (missing OTP).

## ✨ Improvements Made
- Replaced “Continue” with a dynamic arrow icon for more engagement.
- Added food imagery (Burger, Coke, Samosa) to create a stronger food vibe.
- Used curved red shapes to guide attention and add visual warmth.
- Designed OTP screen to complete user journey and build trust.
